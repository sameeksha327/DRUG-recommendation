This project, Drug Recommendation System Based on Sentiment Analysis of Drug Reviews Using Machine Learning, extensively employs Python for *data processing, machine learning, sentiment analysis, visualization, and recommendation system development*.  
 *1. Data Collection & Preprocessing*  
- Python handles *loading and cleaning* drug review datasets from online sources.  
- Text preprocessing steps include *removing punctuation, tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization, and vectorization* (TF-IDF, Word2Vec).  
- Data is converted into numerical format using *scikit-learn* to train machine learning models.  

*Libraries Used*: pandas, numpy, nltk, scikit-learn  

*2. Sentiment Analysis with Machine Learning*  
- The project applies *machine learning classifiers* such as *Logistic Regression, NaÃ¯ve Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest* to classify drug reviews as *positive or negative*.  
- *Linear SVC with TF-IDF vectorization achieved the highest accuracy (93%)* for sentiment prediction.  

 *Libraries Used*: scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras  

*3. Drug Recommendation System*  
- Python implements a *hybrid recommendation system*:  
  - *Collaborative Filtering* (user-based and item-based).  
  - *Content-Based Filtering* (sentiment-based similarity measurement).  
  - *Hybrid Approach* combines both for better recommendations.  

 *Libraries Used*: scipy, numpy, sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity  

*4. Model Evaluation & Performance Metrics*  
- The model is evaluated using *accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curves*.  
- *Matplotlib and Seaborn* generate visualizations of sentiment distribution and recommendation accuracy.  

 *Libraries Used*: matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn.metrics  

*5. Web-Based Implementation with Flask*  
- Python's Flask framework builds a *web-based interface* where users can:  
  - Upload drug review datasets.  
  - Train machine learning models.  
  - Get personalized drug recommendations.  

 *Libraries Used*: Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  

 *Conclusion*  
Python enables the *end-to-end development* of the drug recommendation system, from *data preprocessing and sentiment analysis to real-time drug recommendations*, improving healthcare accessibility and decision-making. ðŸš€
